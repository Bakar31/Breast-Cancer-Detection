# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast cancer detection with screening mammograms obtained from regular screening.

## Motivation
According to the WHO, breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were 2.3 million new breast cancer diagnoses and 685,000 deaths. Yet breast cancer mortality in high-income countries has dropped by 40% since the 1980s when health authorities implemented regular mammography screening in age groups considered at risk. Early detection and treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities. In this project, I developed multiple cancer detection models from routine mammography scans and compared their performance.
